## Background
Diabetes continues to be a growing chronic disease around the world. The CDC states that [122 million Americans](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/library/socialmedia/infocards.html) have this chronic disease. In addition, the International Diabetes Federation(IDF) has found that 463 million individuals worldwide with a projected rise of up to [700 million people](https://www.idf.org/aboutdiabetes/what-is-diabetes/facts-figures.html) by 2045. 

Even though diabetes is a well known health condidtion, there are still a lot of misconcetions. Many believe that diabetes is connected to obesity but many studies have proven that it’s not the case! Also, diabetes type 1 & 2 aren’t the only types that you could get.

Because of this, early detection is key which is why we decided to make a quick questionnaire for you as the first step to check if you have diabetes. 

We also want to provide you with additional information about diabetes so that you can stay informed about this growing chronic illness.
